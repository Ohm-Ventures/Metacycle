### Ohm-Ventures Overview:

Electrification of cars, trucks, motorcycles and the like have a tremendous opportunity to provide an exciting ownership experience for everyone. However many times the design decisions of the products we live with day to day are either misguided or suboptimal. The intention in this community is to break down barriers that lead to frustrating product experiences in an open and collaborative way. We intend to do the following.

Foster a friendly and open community that welcomes everyone to participate
Share, document and provide technical information to reduce the resistance of tinkering with the products we use
